Explicit Wait: wil wait for a specific element and specific condition
                - elementToBeClickable();
                - visibilityOfElement();


                               Implicit Wait vs Explicit Wait
                Implicit Wait:
                -will be created once and it will affect driver until driver.quit() method!
                - handling noSuchElementException!


                EXPLICIT WAIT :
                - will create explicit wait for a specific element and when the element executed
                will not affect any other element!
                - handle the exception depends on which method we use!
